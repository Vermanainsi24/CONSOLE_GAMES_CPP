# Console Games in C++

This repository contains a collection of fun and interactive console-based games built using C++. Below is a summary of each game:

## 1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
   A classic 3x3 grid game where two players take turns to mark their symbol (X or O) with the goal of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## 2. **Snake Game**
   A fun and challenging game where the player controls a snake that grows in size as it eats food. The goal is to avoid hitting walls or the snake’s own body.

## 3. **Hangman**
   The player must guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of the figure is drawn.

## 4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
   A simple game where the player selects one of three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to compete against the computer’s random choice. The winner is determined by the rules of the game.
